Kentucky Legislature

This website's function is currently to display all of the state representatives and state senators for Kentucky. There's a home page, Representatives page, Senators page and Contact Us page. I intend to eventually give each politician their own page and profile that will be linked thru the representatives or senators pages.<br>
The home page is fairly straight forward. A simply nav bar. I created the background and images for the quote in Adobe XD.<br>
The Representatives page has 100 representative listed alphabetically by last name. It includes name, district and political party. You can jump to particular candidates faster by using the side navigation by clicking M for "Savannah Maddox" for instance. On smaller screens where the navigation runs off the screen you can scroll the letters up or down accordingly to see the full list of letters.<br>
The Senators page works exactly like the Representative page, but it only has 32 politicians on it.<br>
The Contact Us page allows you to enter your name, email and message in to contact me. I created this using java script.
